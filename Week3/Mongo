What is Mongo?
We can gather data from across the database and query for the things it is related to
If we take an object and save it to a database, we had to have structure, and write a sql statement that accepts here is the object and then insert them into the table as a value
if mongo does not leverage tables, it stores it as another form of data
instead of keeping track of the data, we are looking for another kind of conversion
Mongo saves the data in BSON
    a binary script - Binary JSON
We will have tools that we dont have to manage the translation
When we store objects in a Mongo DB how do we identify it
    How do I know where I put a particular resource?

We connot use JDBC when using Mongo
    We need a Mongoclient. We need to add a new dependancy to use this

SQL is a spreadsheet
Mongo is a file cabinet

You can put two dissimilar things (file and folder) into mongo and it will not care

Mongo is NoSQL
