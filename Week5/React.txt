React lets us host
NPM provides access to tools
VITE lets us start writing code and transpiles it into something we can use
    npm create vite@latest expense-tracker
    use arrow keys in terminal
    select React
    then javascript
    do not use rolldown
    do not select npm and start now

cd expense-tracker
npm install
    will create node_modules folder
    ignore node_modules folder so that it does not get uploaded to git
    we get all the dependancies we need
npm run dev
    we can open http://localhost:5173

App.jsx- the application is being ran here
    we have the funation app and this is how we make it available to ,available
    the export is what makes it available to the other files
    the css selector will be adding function to the class name
    jsx will be similar to html

During our walkthrough we fully deleted the app.css file
then deleted all conten from inside index.css

tailwind will help us write css
    if we add classes to jsx (create element)
    tailwind will help us create the class for me

we will install tailwind using npm
npm
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
open vite.config.js
    add tailwindcss() to plugins
    import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

go to index.css
    @import "tailwindcss";
now we can start adding to App.jsx

delete app.css import from app.jsx file

make sure to be saiving files constantly


add component folder to src folder
added ExpenseItem.jsx to this folder
import ExpnseItem from './component/ExpenseItem' added to app.jsx


in order to run an app when your pulling since node_modeules werent there
use: npm install
npm clean install
    or npm ci


create loca api using
    json-server ./expenses.json -p 3000
http://localhost:3000/expenses

(if not working we will use npm install -g json-server)
