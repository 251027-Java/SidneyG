Spring - a framework that will give us an easier time building an API or client
    Will give us the power to change how we deal with data

To start a spring project -
    We dont start from scratch
    we have a tool that builds everything for us
    using - start.spring.io
        maven, Java, 4.0.0
        jar, properties, 25

http://localhost:8080/api/hello
http = Protocol
localhost = Server
808 = Port
/api/hello = route

/api/hello/?key=value


user -(http)-> controler -> service -> repo -> DB
controller - http translate - DTO Data Tranfer Object
Service - bus. lage - Classes
Repo - java db - DAO data access Object
