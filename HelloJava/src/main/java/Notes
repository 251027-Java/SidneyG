LOOP NOTES
For - counted by an iterator
While - Continue until False
Do-While - Run 1, then continue until False
For Each - use an iterable



ARRAY NOTES
array - a contiguous (ordered) collection of similar data type values
[ _, _, _, _, _ ]
if we need to modify the length of the array we will need to make a new one (recreate it somewhere else) like on the heap
we can navigate through indexing
